## Project Overview <a name="Project Overview"></a>

Arvato Financial Solutions is a German Company that offers big data solutions, IT, analytics and financial services to give their customers the best possible platform for growth. In this business case, Arvato is looking to help their customer, A mail-order company identify potential customers out of the general population (Germany). This will allow their mail-order company with their marketing for their mail-order sales to grow.
In this project, I will analyze demographics data for the company’s existing customers and compare the features to the general population in Germany. This will help to understand what demographic attributes are mostly seen in their customer pool.
Additionally, Arvato would like to have a predictive model that can help their customer to target which individuals out of the general population that are most likely to response to their campaigns. 
Those following datasets are given by the mail-order company customer. All tables required for this project are provided by the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer course. Due to the sensitivity nature of the demographics data, the data cannot be found in the Kaggle Competition page.
